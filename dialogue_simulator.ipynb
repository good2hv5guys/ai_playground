    "Interviewer: Welcome to ABC Controls, David. I am Tom.\n",

    "Interviewer: Nice to meet you too, how are you doing today?\n",
    "Interviewee: I am doing well, and yourself?\n",
    "Interviewer: Great, thanks. I hope we didn't keep you waiting for long?\n",
    "Interviewee: No, I had the chance to talk to one of your engineers while waiting.\n",
    "Interviewer: That's good. David, shall we start?\n",
    "Interviewee: Yeah, sure.\n",
    "Interviewer: First of all, let me introduce myself. I am the manager of our engineering department here and we have an open position, so we have been interviewing applicants to fill the position as quickly as possible.\n",
    "Interviewee: Yes sir, I read about the position on your website, and I think I am a good fit.\n",
    "Interviewer: We currently have several ongoing projects and the team is working hard. We are hoping to keep busy for a long time.\n",
    "Interviewee: What are the essential qualifications required for the position?\n",
    "Interviewer: This is an entry-level engineering position, we do provide a lot of training here. But we do require that you have at least a bachelors degree in computer engineering. Previous experience in the field is a plus.\n",
    "Interviewee: What kind of experience would you count as a work in the field?\n",
    "Interviewer: Even though we provide training, it would be great if you had some hands-on programming experience, knowledge of database systems or skills on developing applications.\n",
    "Interviewee: My final school project was actually developing a mobile application, so I am fairly competent in developing mobile and web applications.\n",
    "Interviewer: That's good to hear, which school did you graduate from?\n",
    "Interviewee: I was a student at DEF University, and I graduated with a bachelor degree in computer science. I worked as a computer lab tutor in school for about 2 years. Guiding students through their projects helped me get experience in several programming languages.\n",
    "Interviewer: What are you looking for in a job?\n",
    "Interviewee: The job should definitely help me grow in my career. I will be happy to learn and grow as I work in a passionate company like yours.\n",
    "Interviewer: You are right. There is plenty of room for advancement in our company. What are your strengths? Why should I hire you?\n",
    "Interviewee: I am a diligent person and a fast learner. I am very eager to learn. My friends also find me very easy to work with.\n",
    "Interviewer: Very well. Now, do you mind working overtime?\n",
    "Interviewee: No, I do not.\n",
    "Interviewer: Because, sometimes we get overwhelmed with heavy workload.\n",
    "Interviewee: I understand that's the nature of the job. When I was going to school, I took quite a few courses each semester while working at least twenty hours every week. And, I handled that situation very well.\n",
    "Interviewer: Do you have any questions for me?\n",
    "Interviewee: No, I think I have a pretty good understanding of the requirements. I believe that I can handle it with ease, and the fact that you provide all the training sounds excellent. I hope to have the opportunity to work for you.\n",
    "Interviewer: David, It is nice to meet you. I can tell that you are a good candidate. Expect to hear from us within a week or so about the job.\n",
